# NDVisualizer

**NDVisualizer** (**N**-**D**imensional **Visualizer**) is a high-dimensional data exploration tool that allows you to slice and visualize datasets in 1-D, 2-D, and 3-D representations.

This tool was developed as a free, lightweight alternative for inspecting simulation datasets generated by the [Ansys Lumerical® Suite](https://optics.ansys.com/). Based on my research, no existing tool served this specific purpose—please let me know if you are aware of any. 

NDVisualizer currently supports [matrix and rectilinear datasets](https://optics.ansys.com/hc/en-us/articles/360034409554-Introduction-to-Lumerical-datasets) saved in Matlab® data files (.mat). It can also be used to visualize any datasets with the same structure. Suggestions and contributions are welcome!
